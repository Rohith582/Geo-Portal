This version builds upon Version_1 by adding functionalities like interactive charts to visualize data, legend control for the map, and improved map interaction features.

### version 3:
This is the most advanced version of the application, incorporating all functionalities from previous versions and adding features like a navigation bar, sidebar for filtering data, search functionality for dropdowns, and improved code structure and organization.
